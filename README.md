## Kalman Filter 1D Implementation ##

This repository demonstrates the application of a 1D Kalman Filter to denoise a simulated time-series signal (a noisy sine wave).
It compares a manual implementation of the Kalman filter with a built-in version from the "filterpy" library.


** What This Project Does

- Simulates a noisy sine wave
- Applies the Kalman filter (manual and built-in)
- Visualizes and compares the results


** Libraries Used

- numpy
- matplotlib
- filterpy



**Applications

This basic Kalman filtering concept can be extended to:
- fNIRS preprocessing
- EEG/ECG denoising
- Time-series prediction
- Robotics and control systems


** Files

- "Kalman_Filter_Implementation.py": Python code for simulation and filtering
- "Figure_*.png": Visualization of the results
